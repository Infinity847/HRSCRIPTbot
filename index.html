<h3>How does the robot speak?</h3><br>
<p>
The robot simply speaks because of the javascript function. This function requires no extension at all.<br>
Sorry, if the robot's tone is a bit boring. I didn't really have a choice. Though if I did, then I would<br>
make the robot sound like Rick Astley
</p><br>
<h3>How does the robot know how to speak?</h3><br>
<p>
The robot does not have a mind, unlike you. It all starts at the server. The server sends the data and<br>
the javascript file uses it to determine what to say. The server is not that hard to make don't worry.<br>
I got the server side working in ten minutes.
</p><br>
<h3>How smart is the robot?</h3><br>
<p>
The answer is crazy. I had to research for like 2 hours, and found that it requires at least 45 IQ to say<br>
simple words. So this means, that my robot must be 45 IQ. I'm surprised, because I was expecting it to be 0.<br>
Don't try to ask it math problems because it wont say anything.
